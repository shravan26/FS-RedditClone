# FS-RedditClone
This is a full stack application built in Typescript, Postgres, TypeORM, TypeGraphQL, GraphQL, ChakraUI, Urql, Express, Redis and NodeJS. It is a reddit clone, where
users can post, upvote/downvote posts, login/register/forget-password/logout. 

This application was a code along from Ben Awad's 14 hr video. A brilliant video if you're interested, here's the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ypD7qv3Z8

I plan to add some additional features like commenting and profile creation.
Here's a demo video on the application if you're interested. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ER1SjzWza6ap-juirLIWu6ERnn2KeOrB/view?usp=sharing
